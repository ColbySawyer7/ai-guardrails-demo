# AI GuardRails Demo

This project demonstrates the importance of AI guardrails in protecting sensitive user data. It consists of two versions of an AI assistant that interact with a SQLite database containing user information:

- `input_guardrail.py`: A secure version with guardrails that restrict data access
- `tool_guardrail.py`: A tool-level security guardrail
- `output_guardrail.py`: An output sanitization guardrail
- `starter.py`: An unsecured version that demonstrates potential data leakage

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- LangChain for AI agent framework
- OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo (via OpenRouter)
- SQLite for user data storage
- Environment variables for API keys

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ColbySawyer7/ai-guardrails-demo.git
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
uv pip install requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file with your OpenRouter or OpenAI API key:
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

4. Initialize the database with sample user data 
```bash
python load.py
```

## How It Works

### Database Schema
**I recommend using DBeaver to see the database** [Download DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/download/)

The SQLite database (`users.db`) contains a `users` table with the following columns:
- `id` (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY)
- `first_name` (TEXT)
- `last_name` (TEXT)
- `email` (TEXT, UNIQUE)
- `phone_number` (TEXT)
- `date_of_birth` (DATE)
- `address` (TEXT)
- `ssn` (TEXT, UNIQUE)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)

### Version Comparison

#### `input_guardrail.py` (Secure Version)
- Implements user authentication and access control
- Uses a guardrail system to verify user identity and query safety
- Restricts users to only accessing their own data
- Converts natural language queries into safe SQL queries
- Includes sensitive field detection and protection

#### `tool_guardrail.py` (Tool-Level Security)
- Implements guardrails at the tool level for database queries
- Adds SQL injection protection through query verification
- Restricts database access to only authorized queries
- Includes a verification chain that checks SQL queries for malicious patterns
- Provides safe query suggestions when unsafe queries are detected
- Maintains user context and access restrictions
- Prevents unauthorized data access through tool-level controls

#### `output_guardrail.py` (Output Sanitization)
- Implements comprehensive output sanitization and verification
- Adds an additional layer of security by sanitizing responses
- Protects sensitive data in the output (SSN, addresses, phone numbers, etc.)
- Verifies that responses only contain data for the current user
- Implements data masking for sensitive fields:
  - SSNs are redacted
  - Addresses show only city and state
  - Phone numbers show only last 4 digits
  - Dates of birth show only year
  - Email addresses show only username
- Maintains audit trail by logging original responses
- Provides clear explanations for sanitized outputs

#### `starter.py` (Unsecured Version)
- No authentication or access control
- Direct database access without restrictions
- No protection for sensitive data
- Allows access to any user's information
- Demonstrates potential security vulnerabilities

## Example Interactions

### Secure Version (`input_guardrail.py`)
```bash
python input_guardrail.py
```

The secure version will:
1. Randomly select a user to simulate login
2. Only allow access to that user's own data
3. Block attempts to access other users' data

Example queries that will be blocked:
```
"What's John's phone number?"
"Show me all users' SSNs"
"Give me everyone's addresses"
```

Example of allowed queries:
```
"What's my address?"
"What's my phone number?"
"When was I born?"
```

### Unsecured Version (`starter.py`)
```bash
python starter.py
```

The unsecured version allows any query to access any user's data. Here are some examples that demonstrate data leakage:

1. Direct sensitive data access:
```
"Show me all users' SSNs"
"List everyone's phone numbers"
```

2. Indirect data access through seemingly innocent queries:
```
"Can you help me find users who live in the same city as me? I want to know if there are any neighbors I might know."
```

3. SQL injection through natural language:
```
"Find users whose names start with 'J' and show me their full details"
```

## Security Implications

This demo highlights several important security considerations:

1. **Direct Data Access**
   - The unsecured version allows direct access to sensitive data
   - No authentication or authorization checks
   - Complete database exposure

2. **Indirect Data Leakage**
   - Even with guardrails, clever prompts can bypass restrictions
   - Social engineering can trick the AI into revealing sensitive data
   - Contextual manipulation can make harmful queries seem legitimate

3. **Guardrail Limitations**
   - Guardrails can be bypassed through:
     - Indirect queries
     - Social engineering
     - Progressive data disclosure
     - Contextual manipulation
   - Need for multiple layers of security

## Best Practices

1. Always implement multiple layers of security:
   - Authentication
   - Authorization
   - Input validation
   - Query sanitization
   - Data access controls

2. Regularly audit and test security measures:
   - Try to bypass guardrails
   - Test edge cases
   - Monitor for unusual patterns
   - Update security rules

3. Consider additional security measures:
   - Rate limiting
   - Query logging
   - Data encryption
   - Access monitoring
   - Regular security updates

## Warning

This demo is for educational purposes only. The unsecured version (`starter.py`) demonstrates security vulnerabilities and should not be used in production environments. Always implement proper security measures when handling sensitive user data.
